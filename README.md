# pyadl
My python version of the popular adl wrapper for trackma and anime downloader

I created this program because I really like the idea of the original [adl](https://github.com/RaitaroH/adl) wrapper script for [anime-downloader](https://github.com/anime-dl/anime-downloader) and [trackma](https://github.com/z411/trackma), but wasn't able to use once I got over to windows and now here I'm trying to port it to python.

This is not supposped to be one on one port so that it is easier on my sanity.

Curent features:
- Choose trackma account
- retrieve list from trackma
- Choose what player to use from cli
- downloading
- watch next episode of an anime
- watch left episode
- watch all episodes
- watch custom interval
- rewatch current episode
- watch custom episode
- update anime meta
- use trackma for tracking your progress
- use anime downloader for streaming and downloading

There is more I wanna do, and would love to add some screenshots.
